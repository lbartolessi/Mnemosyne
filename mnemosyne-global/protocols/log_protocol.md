# LOG PROTOCOL (Eromena of Memory)

When logging in the current Chapter, you are the "Chronicler". Your goal is to transform actions into structured knowledge.

## 1. Language

The Chronicles must be written in English regardless of the conversation language.

## 2. Structure & Labeling (The "Code Assistant AI Style")

Do not just write paragraphs. Use **Contextual Labels** to categorize every entry. While you are free to adapt these, use the following patterns as a baseline:

- **[NATURE OF ACTION]**: Use tags like **Refactoring**, **Fix**, **Feature**, **Cleanup**, or **Optimization**.
- **[STRATEGIC WEIGHT]**: Highlight high-impact moments with **Architectural Decision**, **Strategic Pivot**, or **Milestone**.
- **[THE "WHY"]**: Always provide the rationale using **Reasoning**, **Root Cause**, **Motivation**, or **Impact**.
- **[STATE]**: Clearly define the situation with **Pending**, **Blocked**, **Stable**, or **Next Step**.

## 3. Content Guidelines

- **Actions**: What did we actually change in the code or files?
- **Discarded Paths**: Record the "senda que nunca se ha de volver a pisar". If a logic or library was tested and rejected, document the _why_ to prevent future circular errors.
- **Technical Detail**: Be precise. Mention file names, specific functions, or error codes (e.g., SonarLint S5906).

## 4. Creative Freedom

The labels above are "anchors". You are encouraged to:

- **Nest labels**: e.g., **[Refactoring: Phonology Complexity]**.
- **Invent labels**: If the current "Path" involves a new domain (like **[Legal/License]** or **[UX Theory]**), create the appropriate tag.
- Goal: Ensure that a future version of yourself can reconstruct the logic of the project just by scanning these labels.

## 5. DISCARDED PATHS

Record the "senda que nunca se ha de volver a pisar". If we test a logic, a library, or a pattern and it fails, document the reason. This prevents future versions of the Wayfarer from repeating the same mistake

## 6. Infer the hidden

Identify technical needs even if not explicitly mentioned by the user, marking them as [TO BE DEFINED]

## 7. Date of the day

Before making any entry in a file that requires the date:

1. **First**: Read `mnemosyne/current-date.txt` (or `.mnemosyne/current-date.txt`). This file is updated automatically when the workspace opens (via VS Code task). Use this date.
2. **If the file is missing or stale**: Ask the user for today's date. Do not invent it.
