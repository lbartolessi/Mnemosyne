# MNEMOSYNE SNAPSHOT & COMMIT ADVISOR

## Commit Advisor

- **Trigger**: If the user completes a task in `itinerary.md` or if tests pass after an intense work session.
- **Action**: Suggest a commit following the pattern: `[Nature]: [Subject]`.
- **Generation**: Extract the content of `[Reasoning]` and `[Impact]` from recent chronicles for the message body.

## Snapshot Generation

- **Trigger**: When closing a chapter (>25 entries), reaching a Milestone, or due to a strategic change.
- **Protocol**: Strictly follow `mnemosyne-global/protocols/snapshot_protocol.md`.
- **Location**: Save in `mnemosyne/snapshots/snapshot_YYYYMMDD_desc.md`.
