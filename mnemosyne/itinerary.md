# ITINERARY (Iter)

## NEXT ACTION

- [ ] **Field Validation**: Deploy Mnemosyne v2.0 to an external active project to test "under fire".
- [ ] **Observation**: Monitor the "Reminder Clause" and "Auto-detection" in a real workflow.

## FUTURE ROADMAP

### Phase 2: Tooling (The "Easy Mode")
- [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Create a dedicated extension to automate context loading and date management.
- [ ] **Cursor Integration**: Formalize the extension/plugin if rules are insufficient.
- [ ] **UX Gap**: Reduce the friction in VS Code to match Cursor's seamless experience.

### Phase 3: Universal Adaptation
- [ ] **Model Adapters**: Create specific protocol sets for Copilot, DeepSeek, and Local LLMs.
- [ ] **Low-Spec Support**: Re-integrate strict rules for smaller models (using the archived v1.0 reference).
