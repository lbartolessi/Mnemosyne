# Mnemosyne

**Cognitive architecture and persistent memory for AI-assisted development.**

Mnemosyne acts as a bridge between your project and your AI assistant (Cursor, Copilot, Gemini), providing a persistent memory structure and context-aware workflows.

## Features

- **Initialize Project**: Sets up the `.vscode/mnemosyne-core` and `docs/mnemosyne` structure.
- **Context Injection**: Automatically injects `.mdc` rules for Cursor users.
- **Session Management**: Tracks daily sessions and project phases.

## Usage
Run the command `Mnemosyne: Initialize Project` to start.
